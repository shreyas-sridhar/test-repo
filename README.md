The HAM is an offline, peer-to-peer encrypted messaging system built in Rust using libp2p. It enables nearby devices to communicate without internet access, cellular data, or central servers.
Dev is ongoing and many things to add in obvio and the core messaging part works as of now on the same WIFI connection but thinking of making it more secure using maybe bluetooth mesh tech maybe. 

would love any insights if yall have 

project was made by taking inspiration from the movie "Dhurandhar" + "Bit-Chat" (The new venture of ex-Twitter CEO Jack) + my 3rd sem INCS mini project.
